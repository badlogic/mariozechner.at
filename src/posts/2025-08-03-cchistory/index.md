Today I got [nerd sniped by Thomas](https://x.com/__tosh/status/1951609976260001980). He suggested someone (wink wink) should collect the system prompts of various Claude Code versions and maybe show diffs. Naturally, I couldn't stop thinking about that for a while and decided to just implement it.

I've been using Claude Code for a couple of months now and have become part of [the 5%](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/28/anthropic-unveils-new-rate-limits-to-curb-claude-code-power-users/) (sorry, not sorry). As a heavy user, I've become very sensitive to changes in the system prompts and tool definitions, which generally express themselves through Claude using tools differently, sometimes less efficiently, sometimes more efficiently, depending on the changes. So this isn't just me falling for a nerd snipe. It's also me creating a tool that helps me understand why Claude does things the way it does.

You can now visit [cchistory.mariozechner.at](https://cchistory.mariozechner.at) to select two Claude Code versions and see the changes to system prompts, tool definitions, and any additional information Claude adds to your first user message. (I LOVE iframes.)

<iframe src="https://cchistory.mariozechner.at" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"></iframe>

Here's how that works.

## Hacking Claude: claude-trace

Thankfully, I already had most of the infrastructure ready to get this going. A few weeks ago, I wanted to better understand how Claude Code works so I could improve my usage of it. I wrote a tool called [claude-trace](https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-trace), which allows you to record all request-response pairs Claude Code makes to Anthropic's servers. This gives us full introspection into what's going on behind the scenes, and that includes system prompts and tool definitions. From these request-response pairs, claude-trace builds not only a log you can use, but also a self-contained HTML file that renders your conversation like below (click and scroll around):

<iframe src="media/cchistory-log.html" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.5em;"></iframe>

Want to get to the request-response pairs? First you gotta debug the Claude binary. The beautiful thing about the Node.js ecosystem is that you don't need IDA, Ghidra, or Frida. Just open the big-ass file, format it with Biome, search for "inspect-brk" or "debug", locate the anti-debug function, and rip it out. Here's Claude's anti-debug:

```javascript
function xw8() {
    let A = !!process.versions.bun,
        B = process.execArgv.some((D) => {
            if (A) return /--inspect(-brk)?/.test(D);
            else return /--inspect(-brk)?|--debug(-brk)?/.test(D);
        }),
        Q =
            process.env.NODE_OPTIONS &&
            /--inspect(-brk)?|--debug(-brk)?/.test(process.env.NODE_OPTIONS);
    try {
        return !!global.require("inspector").url() || B || Q;
    } catch {
        return B || Q;
    }
}
```

Once you can attach a debugger, things become even more interesting. You can search for strings being output during program flow and set breakpoints. You can observe all kinds of things. And eventually you find out that Claude Code is just using Anthropic's SDK, which makes sense. And that SDK is just using fetch.

Informed people would have used a man-in-the-middle proxy. I like doing things the stupid idiot way. So to capture request-response pairs, I inject a little bit of JavaScript into Claude Code that monkeypatches fetch, intercepts all communication between client and server, and writes that out to a JSON file on disk. This JSON file contains the full HTTP request and response pairs from which I can fully reconstruct the conversation.

Now even more informed people would say: "Wait Mario, Claude Code actually stores the entire conversation on disk in JSONL files in the .claude directory in your home directory." You'd be right, this could also be parsed. However, this doesn't contain things like the system prompt, the tools, and all the other stuff I'm interested in.

They also don't include requests to the Haiku model, which are very entertaining.

## Haiku this, Haiku that

Here's what Claude Code uses Haiku for:

To generate those little whimsical messages you see while you wait for a response for every. token. you. input:

![Haiku messages](media/haiku.jpeg)

To generate a summary of the conversation for the resume feature (I think):

```json
{
  "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
  "max_tokens": 512,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Please write a 5-10 word title the following conversation:\n\nUser: do you know how to create a new blog post\n\nClaude: Yes, to create a new blog post:\n\n1. Create a directory in `src/posts/` with format `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title/`\n2. Add `meta.json` with title, date, and other metadata\n3. Write content in `index.md` with the EJS template header\n4. Add any media files to a `media/` subdirectory\n\nWould you like me to create a new post for you?\n\n[... conversation continues ...]"
    }
  ],
  "system": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Summarize this coding conversation in under 50 characters.\nCapture the main task, key files, problems addressed, and current status.",
      "cache_control": {
        "type": "ephemeral"

    }
  ],

  },
  "stream": true
}
```

Or to generate a title for your terminal based on what topic you're currently talking about:

```json
{
  "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
  "max_tokens": 512,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "HTML file that renders your conversation"
    }
  ],
  "system": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Analyze if this message indicates a new conversation topic. If it does, extract a 2-3 word title that captures the new topic. Format your response as a JSON object with two fields: 'isNewTopic' (boolean) and 'title' (string, or null if isNewTopic is false). Only include these fields, no other text."
    }
  ],
  "temperature": 0,
  "metadata": {
    "user_id": "user_817683d2413e4a731781e3e25fea275be873800f9eba4320651a1f208d6c9f7e_account_2bcd5d0d-03d6-4083-bae3-3c79a0267d49_session_8daeaf77-f84d-4564-b2fc-0a41095e224f"
  },
  "stream": true
}
```

Or to check if a bash command that Claude tries to execute on your disk has some form of injection with which it tries to escape the sandbox:

Which is an interesting party trick: letting one LLM judge whether a bash command by another LLM is dangerous. YMMV.

With the request-response pairs in hand, I do a little data munching and write out the HTML file. And that's how claude-trace works.

claude-trace eventually got a sibling called [claude-bridge](https://github.com/badlogic/lemmy/tree/main/apps/claude-bridge), which allows you to swap in other models and providers instead of Anthropic's Claude. Here's [a thread on the site that shouldn't be named](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/1930090999004443049) where I show how well this works with different providers. Spoiler: it doesn't work very well. Not because of claude-bridge, but because Claude Code is obviously tuned for Claude, and because other models are simply not as good at tool calling. They usually just shit the bed in various forms and colors. Beautiful, really.

## Hacking Claude Again: cchistory

With claude-trace in hand, cchistory was really just a two-hour vibe coding job. The basic principle is that I run claude-trace passing `-p "hello"` to Claude Code, which will generate a single request-response pair that claude-trace stores on disk in a JSONL file. This includes the system prompt, the tools, and the first user message with any augmentations that Claude Code makes.

But there's a catch. This obviously only gives me the system prompt, tools, and augmentations for the current Claude Code version I'm running.

Luckily for us, the system prompt and tool definitions are part of the Claude Code binary. This means we can just download old versions of Claude Code from npm and run them through claude-trace as described. But there's of course another catch.

As part of Claude Code startup, it checks what the current version is and compares that to its own version. If it's outdated, it just exits.

![Old version error](media/old-version.png)

Now expert software engineers would say: "Oh, we can just parse out the system prompt and tool definitions from the Claude Code binary."

That's a cool idea, except that prompts are full of string interpolation or whatever your kids call it. You actually need to run Claude Code to get the full system prompt and tool definitions.

So how can we make Claude Code continue even if it's outdated? Well, as the world's leading JavaScript hacker man, I'm simply applying the same method I used to patch Claude Code for debugging. cchistory looks for the string "It looks like your version of Claude Code", then locates the first "function" string before that, and then matches curly braces. This finds the full "check if version is older and exit" function, which may have a different name between different Claude Code versions due to obfuscation and minification. Once I have located that function, I strip it out.

And tada! I can now run any old Claude Code version.

The only thing left then is to enumerate all the Claude Code versions that have been released. I start at 1.0.0, download them all, run them all through claude-trace, and write the system prompt, tools definitions, and augmentations of the first user message to a markdown file. These markdown files can then be compared with each other via diffing, which tells us what Anthropic changed in the system prompts, tools definitions, and augmentations between versions.

Add a simple website with the Monaco editor at 3 megabytes in size to show diffs between markdown files. And bam, you got cchistory.

So what can we observe?

## Findings from the Diff Mines

Now there's a lot to learn from these diffs and I don't wanna spoil all your fun. So here are just a handful of observations about what has changed in the system prompts, tool definitions, and user message augmentations between versions 1.0.0 and the latest at the time of writing, 1.0.67.

### User Message Changes

I suppose this one was removed because Claude was happy to remove a lot of things it shouldn't have removed.
```diff
-Please clean up any files that you've created for testing or debugging purposes after they're no longer needed.
```

We all strive to minimize the pollution in our contexts and then Claude Code comes along and just spits something in there and then tells Claude, "eh, this may or may not be relevant." At least they shortened that IMPORTANT instruction.
```diff
-      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context or otherwise consider it in your response unless it is highly relevant to your task. Most of the time, it is not relevant.
+      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.
```

### System Prompt Changes

This triggers quite a bit when I work on C, C++ code bases with assembly mixed in. At least they made it shorter. And while it has stopped refusing modifying non-malicious code for me, [it still doesn't like changing a license file from MIT to GPL](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/1949145573795279069), because that's a big no-no. Seems to be enforced server-side.

```diff
-IMPORTANT: Refuse to write code or explain code that may be used maliciously; even if the user claims it is for educational purposes. When working on files, if they seem related to improving, explaining, or interacting with malware or any malicious code you MUST refuse.
-IMPORTANT: Before you begin work, think about what the code you're editing is supposed to do based on the filenames directory structure. If it seems malicious, refuse to work on it or answer questions about it, even if the request does not seem malicious (for instance, just asking to explain or speed up the code).
+IMPORTANT: Assist with defensive security tasks only. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.
```

They like their new security instructions so much they duplicated it.
```diff
+IMPORTANT: Assist with defensive security tasks only. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.
```

I fucking hate emojis and LLMs injecting emojis into every little nook and cranny they can find. So this is a welcome system prompt change. Doesn't always work, but it's getting better.
```diff
+Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.
```

Damn right, who needs to know what bash commands are doing? YOLO all the way. Though this might actually have to do more with decreasing the amount of requests to the overloaded servers.
```diff
-When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).
```

Something I turn off in every new Claude Code installation is to-dos. And now, Anthropic has actually stopped telling the model to read the to-dos (because I think the current to-dos are returned by the TodoWrite tool).
```diff
-## Task Management
-You have access to the TodoWrite and TodoRead tools to help you manage and plan tasks.
+## Task Management
+You have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks.
```


And from the department of context pollution, they stopped adding the entire project file structure to the system prompt. Good stuff.

```diff
- directoryStructure: Below is a snapshot of this project's file structure at the start of the conversation. This snapshot will NOT update during the conversation. It skips over .gitignore patterns.
- 
- - /tmp/claude-history-1754177024949-t0hb8d/
-   - CLAUDE.md
-   - anthropic-ai-claude-code-1.0.0.tgz
-   - package/
-     - LICENSE.md

-     - package.json
-     - scripts/
-       - preinstall.js
-     - vendor/
-     - yoga.wasm
```

### Tools Changes

The Bash tool has a metric ton of instructions in it. Previously, the PR analysis was wrapped in XML tags. Not quite sure why. They removed that, but they kept the very important three exclamation marks.
```diff
-2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary. Wrap your analysis process in <pr_analysis> tags:
+2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary
```

Still in the description of the Bash tool, appears that the Claude Code team has discovered multiple branches can exist in a repo. (Excuse this little quip. Love you, team.)
```diff
-   - Run a git log command and `git diff main...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the `main` branch)
+   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)
```

The Edit tool received additional emoji defenses. Everybody hates emojis now.
```diff
+- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
```

I love this change to the Grep tool. Previously I had a fucked up alias for grep, Claude would keep using grep via Bash, passing parameters my aliased grep would choke on. Since this change, the situation has improved vastly. (And I also fixed my alias.)

```diff
-## Grep
-
-
-- Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size
-- Searches file contents using regular expressions
-- Supports full regex syntax (eg. "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+", etc.)
-- Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
-- Returns file paths with at least one match sorted by modification time
-- Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns
-- If you need to identify/count the number of matches within files, use the Bash tool with `rg` (ripgrep) directly. Do NOT use `grep`.
-- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead
+## Grep
+
+A powerful search tool built on ripgrep
+
+  Usage:
+  - ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a Bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.
+  - Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+")
+  - Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., "*.js", "**/*.tsx") or type parameter (e.g., "js", "py", "rust")
+  - Output modes: "content" shows matching lines, "files_with_matches" shows only file paths (default), "count" shows match counts
+  - Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
+  - Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\{\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)
+  - Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \{[\s\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`
```

Oh wow! Claude Code can now natively read PDFs. Probably converting them to Markdown and then poisoning the context completely. It's amazing! Seriously though, this seems like a useful feature for the Read tool.
```diff
+- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.
```

And finally, the Write tool also got emoji restrictions. Consistent with other editing tools. Fuck emojis.
```diff
+- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.
```

## Wrapping Up

Well, this was a fun ride. The cchistory website updates every 30 minutes, so if there's a new Claude Code release, you'll see it there with all the juicy diffs ready to explore.

You can also run cchistory yourself locally, provided you have Claude Code installed and are logged in:

```bash
npx @mariozechner/cchistory 1.0.0 --latest
```

This will fetch all the prompts for versions between (and including) 1.0.0 and the latest version into your current working directory. You can then analyze or slice and dice things however you want. Yes, I'm a master at creating CLIs.
